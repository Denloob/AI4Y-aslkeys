# About the project

Unfortunately, not all people can hear or speak, and communication that is taking a very big part of our daily basis becomes a big problem.
Aslkeys is a project which will help you learn the sign language with your friends with the help of artificial intelligence and interactive chat ["EazyChat"].

#### Made by

[Denis], [Itai] and [Yoav] from Israel, The New Bosmat School

DM Den_loob#2209 using [discord](https://discord.com/) or using github to get in touch with the project.

##### Thanks to Akash for the [ASL Alphabet DataSet]

# Our Goals

As we already said, we are trying to make a sign language learning platform that will help you learn ASL with your friends. The AI will be able to recognize the letter through your camera in living and will add the letter to the input field. After you finish typing your message, you can send it to your friends, who can read it and respond to you.

The more people will use our project, the more we will be able to learn sign language and the barrier of communication between people will be removed.
